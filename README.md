The average price for homes meeting the criteria of having three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and at least 2,000 square feet shows variability over the years.

## Conclusion
The average price of homes is influenced by various factors, including location, market conditions, property characteristics, and other variables. The provided data does not show a direct relationship between the year of construction and the average price for this specific subset of homes. Factors such as changes in market demand, economic conditions, and specific property attributes likely have a more significant impact on the average prices observed in the dataset.
